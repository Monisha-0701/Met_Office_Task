A forecaster would like to test the accuracy of historic methods for calculating overnight minimum temperature against our latest modelling. 
<br/>They have the following method from “The Forecaster’s Reference Book"<br/>
          $`T_min=0.316T_12+0.548T_d12-1.24+K `$

**McKenzie** method for accuracy<br/>
         $` 0.5 * (middaytemp + dew_point) - k `$
<br/>

**Error metrics** <br/>
  * MAE <br/>
  * MSE <br/>
  * RSME <br/>
